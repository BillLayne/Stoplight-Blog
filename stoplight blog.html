                    <strong>Warning for NC Drivers:</strong> Under North Carolina's harsh "contributory negligence" rule, if you are found even 1% at fault for an accident, you can be legally barred from recovering a single penny from the other driver. This makes proving fault absolutely critical.

                    <h2>What is contributory negligence in North Carolina?</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="snippet-answer">Contributory negligence is a legal rule in North Carolina stating that if a person contributes to their own injury in any way, even slightly, they cannot recover damages from the other at-fault party. This "all-or-nothing" system makes it vital for accident victims to prove the other driver was 100% responsible.</p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you're approaching a green light on Bridge Street in Elkin. You proceed, and another car runs their red light, causing a T-bone collision. It seems obvious they are at fault. However, their insurance adjuster might claim you were going 5 mph over the speed limit. If they can prove that, contributory negligence could prevent you from getting your car repaired or your medical bills paid.

                    <h2>How do you prove fault in a stoplight accident in NC?</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="snippet-answer">Proving fault in a North Carolina stoplight accident requires gathering objective evidence immediately. This includes the official police report, photos and videos of the scene showing car positions and traffic signals, statements from eyewitnesses, and potentially footage from nearby traffic or security cameras. Your word against theirs is often not enough.</p>
                <p>
                    Without solid proof, the other driver's insurance company will exploit any uncertainty. They might argue you entered the intersection on a yellow light or that their driver had a medical emergency. Your top priority after ensuring everyone is safe is to become an evidence collector.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Key Evidence to Gather at the Scene:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Police Report:</strong> Always call the police. An officer's report is the most critical piece of initial evidence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Photos/Videos:</strong> Document everything from multiple angles—vehicle damage, skid marks, debris, and the positions of the traffic lights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Witness Information:</strong> Get names and phone numbers of anyone who saw the crash. A neutral third-party account is incredibly powerful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nearby Cameras:</strong> Look for cameras on nearby businesses in the Yadkin Valley area. Ask them to preserve the footage from the time of the accident.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Who is usually at fault when a car is turning left at a light?</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="snippet-answer">In a typical left-turn scenario at a North Carolina intersection, the driver turning left is usually found at fault. This is because they have a legal duty to yield to oncoming traffic. However, fault can shift if the oncoming driver was speeding excessively, ran a red light, or was otherwise negligent.</p>
                <p>
                    Left-turn accidents are a classic example of where contributory negligence comes into play. The driver going straight may have had the right-of-way, but if they were distracted by their phone and could have reasonably avoided the crash, an insurance company will argue they share the blame.

                    <h2>What is the "Last Clear Chance" Doctrine in NC?</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="snippet-answer">The Last Clear Chance doctrine is a crucial exception to contributory negligence in North Carolina. It argues that even if you were slightly negligent, you can still recover damages if the other driver had the final opportunity to avoid the accident through reasonable care but failed to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you were unknowingly driving with a broken taillight (a form of negligence), but another driver saw you, had plenty of time to stop, and rear-ended you anyway because they were texting, they had the "last clear chance" to prevent the crash. This doctrine can rescue a claim that would otherwise be denied.

                    <h2>What should I do immediately after a stoplight crash?</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="snippet-answer">Immediately after a stoplight crash, your first priority is safety. Move to a safe location if possible, check for injuries, and call 911 to request police and medical assistance. Do not admit fault. Exchange insurance information with the other driver and use your phone to document the scene extensively with photos.</p>
                <p>
                    The moments after a crash are chaotic, but what you do can make or break your potential claim. Staying calm and following a clear set of steps protects both your health and your legal rights. Avoid discussing the accident details with the other driver; limit your conversation to exchanging necessary information.
